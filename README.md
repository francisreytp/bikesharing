### We are proposing a 21.7 million initial investment to have ClimbGlide started.
This includes: 
- 10.8 million for cost of bike (6000 units)
- 2.9 million for dock system 
- 4 million for operating budget
- 4 million for website and phone app development


### Three major advantages
- Better platform that would support the wifi/GPS connectivity
- Less cost on building docking system
- The opportunity to be the first to take a big scale advancemnet on the bike sharing, that can gain a contract supported by the City.

#### With the continuing growth of tourism in Des Moines every year, it is a great time to invest in the bike sharing business.
